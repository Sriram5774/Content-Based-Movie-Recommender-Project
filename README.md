# Content Based Movie Recommender Project using cosine similarity
Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer “relevant” suggestions to users. 
Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, all function on recommendation systems where the system recommends you the next video or product based on your past activity (Content-based Filtering) or based on activities and preferences of other users similar to you (Collaborative Filtering). 
Likewise, Facebook also uses a recommendation system to suggest Facebook users you may know offline.
Recommendation Systems work based on the similarity between either the content or the users who access the content.
There are several ways to measure the similarity between two items. The recommendation systems use this similarity matrix to recommend the next most similar product to the user.
In this project,i have build a machine learning algorithm that would recommend movies based on a movie the user likes. This Machine Learning model would be based on Cosine Similarity.
